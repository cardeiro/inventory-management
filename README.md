# inventory-management
this stored function is intended to check wheather a certain value is already introduced in a certain table.
If the value(s) already exist in the table, it simply selects the correspondant id to input on another table
if it doesn't exist it adds a new value and writes its newly created id on another table.

Problem arises when i try to protect it against misstyping or the advent of adding similar names.
Have been trying to come up with something resembling wildcards, like command in conjuction with % to no avail.

Thanks in advance for any contribution and feel free to use the concept as your own, even though i realise this can be 
done through something like php or c#, i have a commited interest in putting this to work as a procedure.
